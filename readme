css-tools - make sense of your CSS
===Documentation===

==CSSI==
cssi is a command-line program which reads and parses one or many CSS files, then reports on their structure.
It's unfinished; right now, it parses the CSS file, then sorts and lists the selectors, enabling you to quickly scan for duplicates.
Daemon mode: Output is sent, in a terse form, to stdout.  This is designed to allow front-end tools and interfaces to use cssi.  Long-form output will still be produced, but redirected to stderr.
Options:
	-d,--daemon		Run in daemon mode
	-h,--help		Invocation help
	-t,--trace		Trace the parser state-machine (for debugging)
	-m,--max-warn=<maxwarnings>
					Output of warning messages stops after the <maxwarnings>th.  Default is 10
	-Wall,-Wno-all	Enable/disable all warnings (though there're only two so far)
	-Wnewline		Enable the "Missing newline" warning (two rules on the same line).  This is the default
	-Wno-newline	Disable the "Missing newline" warning
	-Wdupfile		Enable the "Duplicate File" warning.  This is the default
	-Wno-dupfile	Disable the "Duplicate File" warning.  (Duplicate files will be skipped silently)
	-I=<importpath>	Sets the path to use for @import at-rules (default is the current directory)
A filename of - (dash) will cause cssi to read from stdin.
Sample usage:
	$ ./cssi -I=/path/to/css/ /path/to/css/test.css /path/to/css/sub.css
