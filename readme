css-tools - make sense of your CSS
===Documentation===

==CSSI==
cssi is a command-line program which reads and parses one or many CSS files, then reports on their structure.
It's unfinished; right now, it parses the CSS file, then sorts and lists the selectors, enabling you to quickly scan for duplicates.
Informational output goes to stderr.
Daemon mode: Output is sent, in a terse form, to stdout.  This is designed to allow front-end tools and interfaces to use cssi.
Options:
	-d,--daemon		Run in daemon mode
	-h,--help		Invocation help
	-t,--trace		Trace the parser state-machine (for debugging)
	-Wnewline		Enable the "Missing newline" warning (two rules on the same line).  This is the default
	-Wno-newline	Disable the "Missing newline" warning (two rules on the same line)
	-I=importpath	Sets the path to use for @import at-rules (default is the current directory)
A filename of - (dash) will cause cssi to read from stdin.
Sample usage:
	./cssi -I=/path/to/css/ /path/to/css/main.css /path/to/css/others.css 2>&1 | less
